# How to use repo:-
First of all clone repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/ravirajsinh45/image_segmentation_using_opencv.git
```

change working directoy

```
 cd image_segmentation_using_opencv/
```

Install all requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can also create virtual environment for this if you want.

# Steps
* Open [segmentation_using_watershed_algo](https://github.com/ravirajsinh45/image_segmentation_using_opencv/blob/master/segmentation_using_watershed_algo.ipynb) notebook.
* Add path of any image you want to segment and run all cell of notebook.
* It will open 3 windows
  1. Image
  2. Segments
  3. segmented_boundries

* In **Image** window add marker by following below steps
    - click on **1** from keyoard and click on Image window which you fill is same object.
    - now click on number **2** from keyoard once again click on different object in Image window and so on.....
    - you will get output in **Image window** like this ![](https://github.com/ravirajsinh45/image_segmentation_using_opencv/blob/master/images_for_readme/marker.jpg)
* when you click like wise segmentation done in **segments** window and boundry creation on **segmented_boundry**.
* If you want to clear segmentation click **C** key from keyoard.
* If you want to exit click **Esc** key from keyoard.
